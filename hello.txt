WHAT IS 8051 MICROCONTROLLER

The 8051 is an 8-bit microcontroller developed by Intel in 1980.
It is one of the most popular and widely used microcontrollers in embedded systems.

A microcontroller is a small computer on a single chip containing:

* CPU
* Memory
* Input/Output ports
* Timers
* Serial communication

The 8051 is used in devices like washing machines, remote controls, traffic lights, and small automation systems.

MAIN FEATURES OF 8051

* 8-bit CPU
* 4 KB ROM (program memory)
* 128 bytes RAM (data memory)
* 32 I/O pins
* Two 16-bit timers
* UART serial communication
* 5 interrupt sources
* 12 MHz standard clock

---

ARCHITECTURE OF 8051

The internal architecture of 8051 contains:

1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
2. Program Memory (ROM)
3. Data Memory (RAM)
4. Timers and Counters
5. I/O Ports
6. Serial Port
7. Interrupt System
8. Oscillator and Clock

---

MEMORY ORGANIZATION

The 8051 has two types of memory:

1. Program Memory

* Used to store the program code
* Usually 4 KB internal ROM
* Address range: 0000H to 0FFFH

2. Data Memory

* Used to store temporary data
* 128 bytes internal RAM
* Divided into:

  * Register banks
  * Bit addressable area
  * General purpose RAM

REGISTERS IN 8051

Important registers include:

A – Accumulator
B – Register used in multiplication and division
PSW – Program Status Word
SP – Stack Pointer
DPTR – Data Pointer
PC – Program Counter

---

I/O PORTS

The 8051 has four 8-bit ports:

Port 0 – 8 bits
Port 1 – 8 bits
Port 2 – 8 bits
Port 3 – 8 bits

Total = 32 input/output pins

These ports are used to connect LEDs, sensors, motors, displays, etc.

---

TIMERS IN 8051

There are two timers:

Timer 0
Timer 1

Both are 16-bit timers and can be used as:

* Timers
* Counters
* Delay generators

---

SERIAL COMMUNICATION

8051 supports UART communication.

It allows:

* Data transmission
* Data reception
* Communication with PC or other devices

Special registers used:

* SBUF
* SCON

---

INTERRUPTS IN 8051

8051 supports 5 interrupt sources:

1. External Interrupt 0
2. Timer 0 Interrupt
3. External Interrupt 1
4. Timer 1 Interrupt
5. Serial Interrupt

Interrupts allow the microcontroller to respond to important events immediately.

---

ADDRESSING MODES

8051 supports different addressing modes:

1. Immediate addressing
2. Register addressing
3. Direct addressing
4. Indirect addressing
5. Indexed addressing

---

INSTRUCTION SET

The 8051 has a rich instruction set divided into:

* Data transfer instructions
* Arithmetic instructions
* Logical instructions
* Boolean instructions
* Branching instructions

Examples:

MOV
ADD
SUB
ANL
ORL
JMP
CALL
